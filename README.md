# Twitter paraphrase normaliser
Code for the final project of the course Research and Development for the Master Programme in Language Technology 2017-2019, Uppsala University. 

In the project, we build a corpus in Spanish from paraphrases extracted from Twitter data with the aim of using it for text normalisation. This is my own implementation based on the original idea from Xu et al. (2013) with the underlying idea that in Twitter the same information is often conveyed multiple times with slightly different words. Our aim is to collect similar tweets with the assumption that in their differences we will find spelling mistakes and colloquial forms that we can later map to standard forms in a parallel corpus to be used for normalisation. The corpus is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively and shows the potential of the application to create normalisation corpora when a large data set is collected.
