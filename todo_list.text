# Integrate dictionary
# Add additionarl entries?
# lexical similarity penalty



# TESTING
1.- CER and BLEU scores for how well the training model generalises:
    We need to split the corpus in training and dev set
2.- Apply to the Shared Task
# Quality evaluation (looking at specific cases why some happens)
# Quantity evaluation from the shared task


# Optional
- try to clean up the data better (still some emojis and strange symbols showing)
